Bulusu, Kartik V. (2026, January).MAE 3128 Biomechanics-I. [Course lecture notes, codes and presentations]. Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, The George Washington University.[https://gwu-mae3128.github.io/spring2026/](https://gwu-mae3128.github.io/spring2026/)

:::

## Syllabus
The course outline, schedule, course policies etc., presented in this course website will construe the course syllabus for MAE 3128: Biomechanics-I in Spring  2026. 

- This syllabus is subject to change depending on the pace of the class.
- We have a lot to cover in just one semester. This course will move fast and require you to read, attend lectures, solve problems, and study outside of class. 
- I tried to create a comprehensive course schedule, but circumstances do change, and I will update you directly when the schedule changes.

## Note-taking
Each week (almost) you will have to submit handwritten course notes to a notebook provided to you. These notes will summarize the assigned readings for that week. 

- You can upload (through the appropriate Blackboard link) scans or images of your notes. 
- You will receive up to 2.5 points for each note assignment, and your highest 8 note scores will count towards your final grade.
- You will use these notes for exams, so the better job you do, the better you will do on the exams.
- Your notes must be handwritten (research shows that reading, identifying important information, and writing it by hand are highly effective learning tools). 
- If you use a tablet and stylus, that is fine, but typing, copying and pasting, or screenshotting the textbook will not be considered for a grade. 
- If you need an accommodation for the handwritten policy, please contact me, and we will find a solution for you
- You are allowed to work in small groups during in-class problem solving activties.

## Homework 
A total of 4 homework assignments will be given approximately every 3 weeks.  

- The assignments are longer, and you are expected to spend ~3 weeks per assignment.  
- I recommend that you start early so that you have time to complete the assignments and get help if needed. 
- Homework assignments are study tools, and any resource may be used to complete them.  
 
## Lectures
We will meet for lectures, problem solving, and group work once a week.   
**I have not pre-filmed lectures for this course.**   

<!-- ## Quizzes: We will have 4 quizzes and your 3 highest scores will count towards your final grade.  No makeup quizzes will be given.  If you have miss more than 2 quizzes \textit{for documented illness or University obligations} your third quiz score will be the average of your other two.   -->

## Exams  
Two exams (midterm and final) will be given (check the dates now!).  

- They will be based on lectures, assigned reading, homework, and classwork.  
- They will be given in class and will be open-note, closed-book, individual work.  
- Open-notes will be those note submitted for a grade during the course and any additional material the students may generate. 
    - The notes must be strictly hand-written or prints of the tablet-generated, handwritten notes for the exams
    - Tablets, laptops and any handheld deivces will not be allowed during exams.
- A full week's notice is required to request an alternative exam date, except in cases of documented illness. 
- Exams must be completed using paper and pen/pencil only.
- Each exam is worth 30 points and is not strictly cumulative.  However, concepts will build on one another, so knowledge of prior topics may still be required.

## Grading - List of what will be counted and percentages (as used in Spring 2025 and can be changed in Spring 2026).

- In-class problem solving and Homework, 20%
- Course notes, 20%
- Midterm exam, 30%
- Final exam, 30%

<!-- ## Grading Scale (subject to change during Spring 2025) -->

<!-- The following grading scale will be applied at the end of the semester to calculate letter grades: 90-100: A, 84-89: A-, 78-83: B+, 72-77: B, 66-71: B-, 60-65: C+, 56-59: C, 52-55: C-, 46-51: D, 0-45: F.

Grades are "rounded up" to the nearest integer. -->

<!-- 95-100: A, 90-94: A-, 85-89: B+, 80-84: B, 75-79: B-, 70-74: C+, 65-69: C, 60-64: C-, 50-59: D, < 50: F. -->

<!-- <br><br> -->

## Grading and late work policy
- Any questions or disputes about grading must be received within one week of having the graded work returned to the student. 
  - Requests must be rational and submitted in writing (email is acceptable), and the professor may refuse the request.
- There are two exams (midterm and final) in this course.
- There may be instances in the presentations where peer-evaluations may be introduced at the discretion of the instructor.
<!-- - The instructor may seek input from the class and decide if course projects will be done individually, in groups, or in a combination.  -->

**Late submissions on course deliverables will not be accepted, with the following exceptions:**

- Extensions will be granted should there arise due to circumstances beyond your control that impede your ability to complete coursework and turn in a deliverable on time. 
- Notify your professor as soon as feasible in these cases. Examples of such circumstances include (but are not limited to) illness, death in the family, and loss of housing. 
- To ensure fairness toward all students, the instructor will request documentation of such circumstances.

**The grades for the course deliverables will be awared only the student demonstrates all the following:** 

1. Attendance 
2. Satisfactory performance and conduct during the course and 
3. Maintains Academic Integrity

**The instructor may at any time escalate, academic intergrity issues with any potential incident of academic dishonesty, before [Conflict Education & Student Accountability (CESA)](https://students.gwu.edu/cesa) in The George Washington University.**

## Policy on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for the course

  - For the GWU's Artificial Intelligence (AI) Evaluation & Status you may refer to the link posted here: [https://it.gwu.edu/ai-tools-status](https://it.gwu.edu/ai-tools-status)

- **The use of chatGPT or other non GWU-apporved AI-based tools are  STRICTLY NOT PERMITTED by the instructor unless, the instructor provides prioir approvals for all the students registered in the course.**

<!-- - If there are instances where chatGPT or any other generative AI-based models are allowed they will be explicitly communicated by the instructor on select assignments and programming projects. 

- In all other instances where a course deliverable does not entail permitted use of chatGPT or any other AI-based models, the instructors will have the students sign a disclosure form. This form will require that the students document specific prompts used and the outputs generated.  -->

- **Any violations of the aforementioned policy will be reviewed under the** [Academic Integrity Code](https://students.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity) and [Student Rights and Responsibities](https://students.gwu.edu/cesa)

Furthermore, the ethical issues regarding the use of chatGPT or any other AI-based models will be discussed in-class and course policy will be amended according to the findings.

## Academic Integrity Code

Academic dishonesty is defined as cheating of any kind, including misrepresenting one's own work, taking credit for the work of others without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of information. You are not allowed to collaborate on the home works and lab assignments; for programming projects and hardware lab assignments, you can work in teams only if they are designated as team projects (labs). Unless otherwise specified, you cannot search for solutions or code on the web – but you can use any code that is included in the textbook or lecture notes (but please cite them). I will be using a SW tool that checks for program code similarities – any pair of programs or written reports with greater than 10% similarity will be closely examined.

The Office of Academic Integrity maintains a permanent record of the violation.
More information is available from the Office of Academic Integrity at <https://students.gwu.edu/cesa>. The University’s “Guide of Academic Integrity in Online Learning Environments” is available at <https://students.gwu.edu/cesa>. Contact information: rights@gwu.edu or 202-994-6757.
