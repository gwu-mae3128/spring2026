### Course description
This Biomechanics course introduces the mechanical analysis of biological tissues and systems, with an emphasis on both fundamentals and applications. Students first explore the historical development and modern scope of biomechanics, then learn the foundations of continuum mechanics as they apply to biological materials. 

This course teaches the mechanical analysis of biological systems. This includes characterization of living tissue and the applications of statics, solid mechanics, kinematics, and elementary dynamics to the human musculoskeletal system.

Building on this, the course develops equilibrium equations and constitutive relations for biosolid mechanics, and applies these tools to understand the behavior of hard tissues (such as bone and other load‑bearing structures) and soft tissues (such as muscle, tendons, ligaments, and other compliant biological materials).
