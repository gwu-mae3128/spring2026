    "text": "Academic Integrity Code\nAcademic dishonesty is defined as cheating of any kind, including misrepresenting one’s own work, taking credit for the work of others without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of information. You are not allowed to collaborate on the home works and lab assignments; for programming projects and hardware lab assignments, you can work in teams only if they are designated as team projects (labs). Unless otherwise specified, you cannot search for solutions or code on the web – but you can use any code that is included in the textbook or lecture notes (but please cite them). I will be using a SW tool that checks for program code similarities – any pair of programs or written reports with greater than 10% similarity will be closely examined.\nThe Office of Academic Integrity maintains a permanent record of the violation. More information is available from the Office of Academic Integrity at https://students.gwu.edu/cesa. The University’s “Guide of Academic Integrity in Online Learning Environments” is available at https://students.gwu.edu/cesa. Contact information: rights@gwu.edu or 202-994-6757."

Students first explore the historical development and modern scope of biomechanics, then learn the foundations of continuum mechanics as they apply to biological materials.\nThis course teaches the mechanical analysis of biological systems. This includes characterization of living tissue and the applications of statics, solid mechanics, kinematics, and elementary dynamics to the human musculoskeletal system.\nBuilding on this, the course develops equilibrium equations and constitutive relations for biosolid mechanics, and applies these tools to understand the behavior of hard tissues (such as bone and other load‑bearing structures) and soft tissues (such as muscle, tendons, ligaments, and other compliant biological materials)."

Bulusu is an Associate Research Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The George Washington University, Washington DC.\nHis research interests span the areas of human health and sustainable energy with focus on mechanics of biological fluids, low-cost energy technologies and applications of wavelet transforms. His current research work on biofluid dynamics of the cardiovasculature, rheology of biological fluids and applications of wavelet transforms has been supported by NSF and the Center for Biomimetics and Bioinspired Engineering (CBBE), GWU.\nHe designed taught a cross-disciplinary course titled, Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing with applications in cyber-physical systems and speech processing.\nIn addition, he developed courses for first year engineering students on the engineering applications of Raspberry Pi, Python programming and mobile App development inspired by social innovation potential during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHe developed a wavelet transform-based computational code (PIVlet) for the analysis of complex vortical patterns encountered in arterial blood flow. He has extensive knowledge of experimental fluid mechanics and non-invasive measurement techniques such as laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), particle image velocimetry (PIV), schlieren imagery, magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) and molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV). Dr. Bulusu was recognized with the ASME Best Paper Award by the Advanced Energy Systems Division (AESD) Heat Pump Technical Committee and William and Louise Corcoron Award for contributing to the intellectual and social life of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, GWU.\n\n\n \nCampus Address: SEH 4614\nOffice Hours: TBA\nEmail: bulusu at email dot gwu dot edu"
